Hey! I'm BradðŸ‘‹ 

Feel free to check out some of my pinned repositories. They are all built from referencing documentation, rather than copying tutorials.

I focus on front-end development with Next.js, but I also play around with back-end technology and some UI/UX tools like Figma so that I have a more encompassing perspective on the development process.

If you want to chat, feel free to reach me at bradvatne@gmail.com.
